## CIS3330-CODE-9-Titanic-Analysis

## Classification algorithms and instructions

Classification algorithms allow analysts to predict customer retention, purchase, referral, and more outcomes. The algorithmic implementation of this quantitative method varies, as well as their ability to predict outcome(s) (single and multi-class).

In this code assignment, you are tasked to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. However, you must perform a descriptive analysis before implementing classification algorithms to describe your training and testing datasets. After your descriptive analysis, use the test and training data sets to develop and test your models. Note that the variable/outcome you are trying to classify is the binary outcome "Survived"
## Deliverables

1. Descriptive analytics report
  * Describe problems with the dataset (e.g., missing values)
  * Describe three columns other than "Survived" from the training dataset.
  * Perform an ANOVA analysis to validate if there is a significant difference between the age of passengers in the test and training datasets.
    * Include a brief conclusion of this analysis. Specifically, explain how your ANOVA findings can affect your classification models.

2. Predictive analytics: classification report

Create a classification model using the following algorithms:

  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Logistic Regression 
  * K-Nearest Neighbor 
  * Naive Bayes 

Report for each algorithm the precision and F1 Score.

## Report reminders

1. Make brief argumentations
2. Only include code you understand and can claim authorship
3. Use visualizations only when adequate
4. Provide a brief conclusion at the beginning or end of the report.
5. Your report organization, comments, and conclusions should allow someone to understand your thought process and replicate your work.
